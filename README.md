# Evaluation-metrics-for-classification
In this assignment, we will be exploring metrics for evaluating classification models. We use the problem in the previous assignment which is Home Credit Default Risk that predicts whether a loan client can repay the loan money. The previous assignment uses the ROCAUC metric which is a really good and widely use in practice for evaluating classification models. In this assignment we look at precision, recall, f1 metrics also plotting the rocauc curve. The purpose of this assignment is not trying to find the best model for the classification problem, we just practice calculating common used metrics instead. We will use Logistic Regression, Gradient Boost Machine and Neural Network for calculating the metrics. Below are the things you will do:

Train Logistic Regression, Gradient Boost Machine and Neural Network models
Compute confusion matrix
Calculate precision and recall
Calculate f1
Plot rocauc graph

Before you continue, ensure you meet the following requirements:

* You have installed the latest version of Spyder or PyCharm.
* You are using a Windown or Mac OS machine. 
* You have a basic understanding of data struction, pandas, numpy, sklearn
```
